# Magic triplet exercise

## Problem statement

Given an integer array arr of size n, find all magic triplets in it.

Magic triplet is a group of three numbers whose sum is zero.

Note that magic triplets may or may not be made of consecutive numbers in arr.


### Example One

Input: arr = [10, 3, -4, 1, -6, 9]

Output: [“10,-4,-6”, “3,-4,1”]


### Example Two


Input: arr = [12, 34, -46]

Output: [“12,-46,34”]


### Example Three

Input: arr = [0, 0, 0];

Output: [“0,0,0”]


### Example Four


Input: arr = [-2, 2, 0 -2, 2];

Output: [“2,-2,0”]


### Notes

Input Parameters: Function has one argument: array of integers arr.

Output: Function must return an array of strings. Each string (if any) in the array must represent a unique magic triplet and strictly follow this format: “1,2,-3” (no whitespace, one comma between numbers).

Order of the strings in the array is insignificant. Order of the integers in any string is also insignificant. For example, if [“1,2,-3”, “1,-1,0”] is a correct answer, then [“0,1,-1”, “1,-3,2”] is also a correct answer.

Triplets that only differ by order of numbers are considered duplicates, and duplicates must not be returned. For example, if “1,2,-3” is a part of an answer, then “1,-3,2”, “-3,2,1” or any permutation of the same numbers may not appear in the same answer (though any one of them may appear instead of “1,2,-3”).

Constraints:

1 n
-1000 arr
arr may contain duplicate numbers.
arr is not necessarily sorted.

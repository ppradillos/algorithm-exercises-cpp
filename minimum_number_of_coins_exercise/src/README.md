# Minimum Number of Coins exercise

## Problem statement

Given a variety of coin types defining a currency system, find the minimum number of coins required to express a given amount of money. 

### Example

Input: Coin types: [1, 4, 7]. Amount to express: 12.

Output: 3

Here are all the unique ways to express 12 as a sum of coins 1, 4 and 7:

1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1

1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4

1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4

1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7

1, 4, 7

4, 4, 4

Last two ways use the minimal number of coins, 3.


### Notes

Assume infinite supply of coins of every type. 
Every input will include a coin of value 1. This guarantees that a solution will always exist.
There will be no duplicate coin types in the input.
